# CreativeCoding2023-2024

Creative Coding is a course designed and taught by David Lynch on behalf of CS++. This course intends on bringing beginners with limited knowledge of computers and programming to a point where they can confidently solve problems and have fun creating works of art through code. This course will follow a cirriculum which takes you from only knowing how to turn on the computer to having a grasp of important concepts in computer science, python programming, problem solving, and general knowledge of information technology.

The core ethos of Creative Coding is to encourage *collaboration and expression* through code! It's key to welcome everyone no matter their background or programming level and stoke their interest and passion in computing.
